# Music Player by Josmhv

This is my first project and my goal with this it's to learn react and backend (express and mongoDB) in one app, introducing me into the Full-stack development world.
#
This music player lets you input urls and automatically creates a playlist> It let you save it in a DataBase in MongoDB and then get it by the name you saved. (this is all for now but i'm planning on adding more functionalitys, in the NOTAS.txt are some of it, any help is welcomed :D)
