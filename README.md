# Music Player by Josmhv

This is my first project and my goal with this it's to learn react and backend (express and mongoDB) in one app, introducing me into the Full-stack development world.

This app lets you input urls and automatically creates a playlist, and it has a player to play the songs. It let you save the playlist into a DataBase in MongoDB and then get it by the name you save it. This is all for now but i'm planning on adding more functionalitys, in the NOTAS.txt are some of it, any help is welcomed :D

I know it is all in spanish but is my native language so I started building it in that language before knowing I will upload it in GitHub. If anyone wants me to translate it let me know.
